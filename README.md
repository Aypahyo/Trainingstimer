# Trainingstimer

I am writing a simple training timer for myself with the help of chatgpt because I want a sort of alarm timer for my daily training routine.

## python starter

I used my home brew python starter project as a base for this project. It is a simple python project with a Makefile and a Dockerfile.

You can see the transitional artefacts in the testing files. As the project grows I will remove them.

## ChatGPT

Thanks to ChatGPT I have a starting point for my project. I did not want to put a lot of effort into it. I just wanted to have a simple timer.

As the project grows I will add more features to it and also replace the chatgpt code with my own code that would then make use of the testing facilities of the starter project.
